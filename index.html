         <p id="testP" class ="fun-Paragraph">Finally decided to have a rode trip before our kids summer break end. 
            Uhmmm...East, South, West, North. where should we go? 
            Want to go somewhere that I never been. One good idea come out to my head. Let's go to west to see some mountain.
            Now,let's start our road trip. 
            One good thing for the road trip is you can go anywhere you like and not really need to plan ahead.

               <p>This is our first stop for the night. We arrived there late. The kids were falled asleep in the car alread. My husband and I hurry up put up the tent and get some rest. The beautiful thing is when you wake up right next to the lake and you are on vacation. No work no stress no worries. </p>
